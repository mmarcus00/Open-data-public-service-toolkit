# Open-data-public-service-toolkit
Mozilla Open Leaders project work


Hi! Welcome to the Open Data Public Services Toolkit repo! 

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 

<b>Who are we?</b>
We are the Open Data Institute, we're an organisations that does all sorts of things to do with Open Data, including advoacy, training, technology development and research. This project is part of a wider research and development programme about how we can help people use data to make better services. 

What are we doing? (And why?)
This project aims to help people working in local governments in the UK overcome the technical, organisational and cultural barriers to making innovative public servces that improve the lives of their communities using data. 

Many public services in the UK are expected to deliver efficiency savings along with improved outcomes for citizens. Open data is already being used to provide better public services in some places in the UK, showing how useful it can be. For example, the release of travel and mapping information in London reduced the need for the the public sector to build services for end users and helped build a new market of digital mapping and travel services to meet peopleâ€™s needs.

There are three different types of public services that open data can help with:

1) Open data for better access to public services
2) Open data for more efficient service delivery chains
3) Open data for more informed public policy development 

If you want to find out more about how data can help public services, have a look at our report here: https://theodi.org/article/using-open-data-for-public-services-report-2/

However, when we talked to people in local governments and service designers, they told us about the porblems they face when trying to use shared and open data to create new, or improve existing services. 

     - Lots of people don't even know what open data is, so they need to build a general understanding in their organisations so that open data can be used when designing services.

    - They need to get their boss' on board with the idea. Using open data is new and unknown so this can be hard. To do this they need to point to examples of where it has worked in other places.

    - It's often hard to find and access open datasets

    - It's often not clear who is accountable for maintaining open datasets so they can be sure they are using good quality data

    - It's hard to get people from different departments in the local gvernment to work together

The Open Data Public Servcices Toolkit will try and help people overcome these challenges. As one of the main issues is getting senior management on board, we are going to structure it around helping people make a great business case. It will pull together simple, practical examples and tools to help with four key themes: 

1) identifying the goal and purpose of the service
2) using data 
3) championing open 


What do we need?
We need people to use the tools to help us make them better. 

How can you get involved?
We have a series of events in the UK coming up to test the toolkits- more info to come on that. 

If you're not in the UK, check out the tools, give them a go on your projects, and let us know what you think.
